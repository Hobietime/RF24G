# RF24G
This library provides a simple way for up to 7 nRF24L01 or nrf52x radios to communicate with each other.

It also supports confirmed delivery via ACKs if desired.

Documentation can be found at https://hobietime.github.io/RF24G/html

Thanks to TMRh20 for updating the library and adding support for the nrf52x radios.
